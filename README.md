## What It Does

The app lets a user connect a local SQLite database or upload CSV files, ask a plain-English question, and receive a table of results. The LLM only receives schema metadata, not raw database rows.

The current branch supports two LLM backends:

- Gemini API, using `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Local Ollama, using a model such as `gemma3`

## Architecture

1. Python extracts SQLite `CREATE TABLE` statements.
2. Schema RAG builds table-level chunks from DDL, columns, and foreign-key relationships.
3. The most relevant schema chunks are retrieved for the user question using hybrid lexical, semantic, and foreign-key graph signals.
4. The user question and retrieved schema are sent to the selected LLM.
5. The LLM returns one SQLite `SELECT` query.
6. Python validates that the SQL is read-only and avoids SQLite internals.
7. SQLite executes the query locally in read-only mode.
8. Streamlit renders the result table.

## Inspiration From Text-to-SQL Research and BI Practice

The Holistics article ["Why is Text-to-SQL so hard?"](https://www.holistics.io/blog/text-to-sql/) argues that reliable Text-to-SQL is difficult because natural language is ambiguous, enterprise schemas are complex, and SQL is a strict execution language. It highlights semantic layers as a way to ground AI systems in governed business concepts, relationships, and metric definitions instead of asking a model to guess from raw table names.

Our prototype applies the same idea at assignment scale:

- The schema/RAG layer acts as a lightweight semantic layer over SQLite.
- Hybrid retrieval selects relevant tables, columns, foreign-key relationships, and safe categorical hints.
- The generated SQL is shown to users for verification.
- SQL execution is governed through read-only validation and local execution.

Unlike a full BI semantic layer such as Holistics AQL, our tool still generates SQL directly. The trade-off is that our prototype is simpler and flexible for arbitrary SQLite databases, but less governed than a production semantic-layer system with centrally defined metrics.

## Schema RAG

The project includes an advanced local schema RAG layer. It does not read or embed row data. It only indexes:

- table names
- column names
- `CREATE TABLE` DDL
- foreign-key neighbor tables
- low-cardinality text value hints, such as status or grade categories

At question time, the backend:

1. tokenizes the user question
2. expands common business synonyms such as `client -> customer` and `revenue -> amount/sales`
3. scores schema chunks with a BM25-style lexical ranking
4. adds local hashed embedding similarity and character n-gram semantic similarity for fuzzy matching
5. adds privacy-safe categorical value hints for low-cardinality text columns
6. decomposes the question into entities, aggregations, filters, and comparisons for explainability
7. adds stronger boosts for exact table and column matches
8. expands through foreign-key neighbors so joinable tables are included
9. sends only the selected schema snippets to the LLM

This improves:

- prompt size for larger databases
- latency and cost
- table selection accuracy
- privacy, because only metadata is retrieved
- explainability, because selected tables, value hints, prompt savings, and schema recall are reported

In the Streamlit sidebar you can toggle schema RAG and adjust how many tables are retrieved. Each answer also includes an optional retrieval report showing selected tables, scores, matched terms, and graph-expansion reasons.

## Safety Model

- Generated SQL must start with `SELECT` or `WITH`.
- Data modification and schema-changing statements are blocked.
- Internal SQLite tables such as `sqlite_master` are blocked.
- SQL is parsed with `sqlglot` when available for AST-level read-only validation.
- SQLite is opened in read-only URI mode.
- `PRAGMA query_only = ON` is enabled during execution.
- A SQLite authorizer denies writes, DDL, transactions, attach/detach, pragmas, analyze, and reindex.
- Results are capped to avoid rendering unexpectedly large outputs.
- If safe generated SQL fails during execution, the system can make one LLM-based repair attempt using the SQLite error message.

```

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Gemini, create `.env` in the project root:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TEXT_TO_SQL_PROVIDER=gemini
```

For local Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3
ollama serve
```

Then select `ollama` in the Streamlit sidebar.

## Run The App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

In the sidebar you can:

- choose Gemini or Ollama
- set the model name
- enable or disable schema RAG
- tune how many schema tables are retrieved
- use an existing `.db` path
- upload a SQLite `.db`
- upload one or more CSV files
- create the built-in university demo database

## Create Demo Data

```bash
python -c "import text_to_sql_agent_mvp as a; a.write_university_db('data/university_agent.db')"
```

## Run Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Run Evaluation

The evaluation harness compares generated SQL results with gold SQL results.
Use `gold` mode first to verify that the benchmark and databases are healthy:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode gold
```

Then run an LLM evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider ollama --model gemma3
```

Outputs are written to `evaluation/results/` as CSV and Markdown summaries.
For Gemini free-tier testing, use a throttle or a smaller smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --delay-seconds 15
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --max-cases 3
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --max-cases 3 --max-retries 2 --retry-base-seconds 30 --resume
```

## Streamlit Community Cloud

For hosted deployment, use:

- Repository: `tuannm3812/aipa-text-to-sql-agent`
- Branch: `tuannm3812/main-refinement`
- Main file path: `app.py`
- Secrets: add `GEMINI_API_KEY`

See `docs/deployment.md` for the full checklist. Ollama is best treated as a local/offline demo option because Streamlit Community Cloud will not have access to your local Ollama server.

## Notes

This is still an MVP. The most important next improvements are persistent embedding-based schema retrieval, SQL parser-based validation, stronger query repair, and richer charting.
