# Agent Collaboration Log

**Append-only.** Correct a past entry by adding a new one, never by rewriting it.
Superseded conclusions stay visible — when a claim later proves wrong, the trail
showing how it was reached is the useful part. Record what was *checked*, not
just what was claimed.

## 2026-09-11 — Phase 1: foundation and standards alignment

**Changed:** Added `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, ruff/mypy/pytest config,
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/0_coding_standards.md`. Split the 284-line test
file into seven per-module files plus `conftest.py`. Deleted
`text_to_sql_agent_mvp.py`. Renumbered `docs/` to Shape B. Rewrote CI as a
3.11-3.13 matrix.

**Verified:** `uv run pytest` 20 passed (18 pre-existing plus two packaging guards). `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`
clean. `mypy text_to_sql_agent` clean. `requirements.txt` installs into a clean
venv. `app.py`'s twelve `backend.*` attributes all resolve against the package
`__all__`. Notebook JSON well-formed, 25 cells, 11 with outputs. The packaging
drift guard was confirmed to fail when `sqlglot` was removed from
`requirements.txt`, then restored. Streamlit app booted locally and returned rows
for one query against the university demo database.

**Found, not fixed:** The shim was a byte-identical copy of `pipeline.py`, not a
wrapper — so `pipeline.py`'s `ask_database` had no test coverage before this
phase. Recorded as roadmap defect 11. The four Phase 2 and Phase 4 defects in
`safety.py`, `execution.py`, `rag.py` and the duplicated evaluation harness were
all left untouched by design; this phase changed no behaviour.

**Open:** Whether `execution.py`'s progress-handler abort is intentional. Nobody
has confirmed it; do not "fix" it in Phase 2 without deciding that first.
